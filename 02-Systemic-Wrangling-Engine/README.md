## ⚙️ Module II: Systemic Wrangling Engine

**Objective:** To architect a repeatable pipeline for resolving data inconsistencies and transforming raw observational records into high-fidelity analytical assets.

### 🧪 Engineering Tasks
* **Noise Reduction:** Identified and rectified structural anomalies in the `Life_Expectancy_Data` and `Kyphosis` datasets.
* **Imputation Strategy:** Deployed statistical measures (Mean/Median/Mode) to handle missing values without introducing variance bias.
* **Feature Synthesis:** Engineered new data dimensions to facilitate deeper exploratory analysis.

### 🛠️ Execution Environment
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Primary Library:** Pandas (The Engine Core)
* **Supporting Tools:** NumPy (Numerical Logic), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visual Synthesis)
